Here's my second article for the LADbible Medium publication: [Let's go, gamers: how we built the GAMINGbible menu](https://medium.com/ladbiblegroup/lets-go-gamers-how-we-made-the-gamingbible-menu-d33115c86e28). Both the component and the article were a team effort with my wonderful colleague [Kieran Duff](https://twitter.com/KieranDuff9), who is much better at explaining intersection observers than I am.

We had a lot of fun both building the menu and writing about it afterwards. There's so much to talk about! There's some React-specific things we used to get it working, but also a lot of Javascript web technology that works across the board.

A huge shoutout to our team mate in UX, Holly Sunderland, who designed [GAMINGbible](https://www.gamingbible.co.uk). She's written [a case study on the design of the menu](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/ux-ui-case-study-inventing-a-new-mobile-navigation-for-gamingbible-d416d9a4619a) for [Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/). The whole site, menu included, was a blast to build, and it's a joy to see it live.

**UPDATE**: At [ReactJS Girls](https://reactjsgirls.com/) Online #2 in April 2021, my fabulous colleague Paulina Orawczak and I delivered a talk on this very subject, with a lot more in-depth explanation of our choices. [Now you can watch our talk on Youtube!](https://youtu.be/eaY8ovn1FzI)
