Here's my second article for the LADbible Medium publication: [Let's go, gamers: how we built the GAMINGbible menu](https://medium.com/ladbiblegroup/lets-go-gamers-how-we-made-the-gamingbible-menu-d33115c86e28). Both the component and the article were a team effort with my wonderful colleague [Kieran Duff](https://twitter.com/KieranDuff9), who is much better at explaining intersection observers than I am.

We had a lot of fun both building the menu and writing about it afterwards. There's so much to talk about! There's some React-specific things we used to get it working, but also a lot of Javascript web technology that works across the board.

A huge shoutout to our team mate in UX, Holly Sunderland (why don't I have you on socials yet, aaaa) who designed [GAMINGbible](https://www.gamingbible.co.uk). The whole site, menu included, was a blast to build, and it's a joy to see it live.
