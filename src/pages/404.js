    <p>
      &apos;Tis not possible!, I pleaded,
      <br />
      But my browser, so conceited,
      <br />
      Remained blank, I then repeated,
      <br />
      Just a blank and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in answer to my query,
      <br />
      Through the net I loved so dearly,
      <br />
      Came its answer, dark and dreary...
    </p>
    <h2>Quoth the server, 404.</h2>
  </Layout>
